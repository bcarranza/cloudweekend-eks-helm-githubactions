I was invited to a conference, and I have focused it on GitHub Actions, 
the ease it can provide us in automating our processes.

We will follow the following steps:

1. Create a basic IAM Role with grants to create a new eks cluster.
    
2. We're going to create our kubernetes cluster using:
- An on-demand GitHub Actions workflow.
- eksctl commands.
